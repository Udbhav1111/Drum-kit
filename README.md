# Drum-kit
My GitHub project "Drum Kit" is a web application that allows users to play drum sounds by pressing specific keys on their keyboard. Each key is mapped to a different drum sound, creating an interactive and engaging way to experience music. The project showcases simple yet effective JavaScript, HTML, and CSS integration.
